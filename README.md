# Sunshine Wellness Center

The idea behind this project originated from the desire to create a mental health-driven website sponsored by Sunshine Wellness Center. This site provides a daily quiz to keep track of your mental health progress, links to helpful information from the Health.Org website, and therapeutic dog photos. The quiz is intended to help users become more mindful and keep track of their mental health and stress levels.

## Audience
The target audience is you, the user behind the screen. We believe this website can be a great resource for all ages, as it enables users to become mindful of their emotions as well as enjoy cute dog photos. If the user needs more assistance in making improvements on their mental health state, the Health.org widget allows the user to research health information specific to their age and sex.

## Quiz
We created a multiple choice quiz that consists of seven questions. There are no right or wrong answers, so please answer freely. The quiz is not timed, so take as much time as you need. Upon completion of the quiz, the user will have their score calculated, based on their answers, and displayed. Quiz scores are stored internally and will be displayed when a user returns to the site.

## Technologies
The programming languages used to crated this project include HTML, CSS (Bootstrap and GoogleFonts), jquery UI, jquery, and JavaScript. The APIS utilized include HealthOrg, dogApi, and moment.js.
